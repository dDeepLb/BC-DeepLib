/**
 * Abstract base class for versioned migration handlers.
 *
 * A migrator is responsible for upgrading or transforming stored data
 * when the mod version changes. Each migrator targets a specific version
 * and executes its {@link Migrate} method once when needed.
 *
 * @remarks
 * To create a new migrator:
 * 1. Extend `BaseMigrator`.
 * 2. Implement the {@link MigrationVersion} getter to return the target version string.
 * 3. Implement {@link Migrate} with the migration logic (e.g., data structure changes).
